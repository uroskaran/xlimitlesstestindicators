XLimitless - Stealth Valuation Index Documentation

Introduction
The "XLimitless - Stealth Valuation Index" is a versatile tool designed to compare 
the relative valuation changes of a primary asset against a selected benchmark 
symbol. This indicator normalizes and visualizes these comparisons, enabling 
traders to identify overbought or oversold conditions and make informed trading 
decisions.

Key Features
- Dynamic Comparison: Measures percentage change in the primary asset’s price 
  against a customizable comparison symbol.
- Customizable Inputs:
  - Primary Length: Define the period for short-term valuation analysis.
  - Additional Length: Analyze a longer-term perspective.
  - Normalization Window: Adjust the range for normalization.
  - Overbought/Oversold Levels: Set custom thresholds to identify extremes.
- Graphical Representation: Plots normalized differences for primary and additional 
  lengths, includes horizontal overbought and oversold lines for quick interpretation.

Setup Instructions

Adding the Indicator:
1. Open TradingView.
2. Navigate to the "Indicators" tab.
3. Search for "XLimitless - Stealth Valuation Index" and add it to your chart.
4. Apply the Intra-Day, Daily, or Weekly Timeframe (input will refer to the chosen 
   timeframe).

Customizing Inputs
- Primary Length (N): Define the number of periods for short-term analysis 
  (default: 10).
- Additional Length: Set the length for additional valuation analysis (default: 30).
- Overbought Level: Define the upper threshold for potential overvaluation 
  (default: 75).
- Oversold Level: Define the lower threshold for potential undervaluation 
  (default: -75).
- Normalization Window: Defines how far back the indicator looks to scale data 
  between (-100, 100), helping traders compare today's values against historical data.

How It Works

Calculation Overview:
1. Percentage Change: Calculates the percentage change in price over the 
   defined primary and additional lengths for both the primary and comparison symbols.
2. Difference: Computes the difference between the primary symbol’s and the 
   comparison symbol’s percentage changes for both lengths.
3. Normalization: Normalizes the differences to a range of (-100, 100) based on the 
   selected normalization window.

Plotting Mechanics:
- Primary Length Plot: Displays short-term normalized valuation differences 
  (white shaded area).
- Additional Length Plot: Displays longer-term normalized valuation differences 
  (blue line).
- Horizontal Lines: Indicate overbought and oversold thresholds for quick visual 
  reference.

Best Practices
1. Combine with Trend Confirmation: Use in conjunction with trend-following 
   tools (e.g., moving averages).
2. Focus on Extremes: Look for divergences when the primary length shows 
   overbought/oversold conditions or wait for the Primary Length and Additional 
   Length to align.
3. Adjust Thresholds: Customize overbought and oversold levels based on the 
   asset’s historical behavior and volatility.

Example Use Case

Scenario:
You are analyzing the performance of Gold (XAU/USD) relative to the US Dollar 
Index (DX1!).

Steps:
1. Add the indicator to your Nasdaq NQ chart.
2. Spot the Trend (Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral).
3. Set the comparison symbol to DX1! or any other symbol for its comparison.
4. Observe the plots:
   - Primary length plot indicates an overbought condition (-75).
   - Additional length plot shows a stable trend below (-50).
5. Conclusion: Nasdaq NQ is undervalued relative to the Bond Market (US30Y), 
   signaling a potential correction.

FAQs

1. What does normalization do?
   - The Normalization Window sets the time range the indicator uses to compare 
     current data against past values, scaling everything to a fixed range of (-100, 100). 
     A shorter normalization window is great for capturing recent trends, while a 
     longer one smooths out short-term fluctuations.

2. Can I compare multiple symbols?
   - Currently, the indicator supports one comparison symbol at a time. You 
     can add multiple instances for additional comparisons.

3. Why are my plots flat?
   - Ensure the primary and comparison symbols have sufficient historical data 
     for the selected lengths and normalization window.
