XLimitless - AI FutureScope Documentation

Introduction
The "XLimitless - AI FutureScope" is an advanced tool that uses historical price data 
to project potential future trends and seasonal movements. By analyzing up to 30 years 
of daily trading data, it identifies potential pivots, trends, and reversals, providing 
traders with actionable insights into market dynamics.

Key Features
- Uses up to 30 years of historical data to compute seasonality and potential price trends.
- Analyzes daily trading activity for high accuracy.

Setup Instructions

Adding the Indicator:
1. Open TradingView.
2. Navigate to the "Indicators" tab.
3. Apply the Daily Timeframe.
4. Search for "XLimitless - AI FutureScope" and add it to your chart or move it to a new pane.

Customizing Inputs
- Lookback Period in Years: Define the historical data range (1 to 30 years).
- Forecast Days: Set the number of future trading days to project (5 to 180 days, Default: 90).
- Smoothing Period: Adjust the level of smoothing applied to seasonal calculations (default: 1).
- Line Color and Width: Customize the color and thickness of the trend lines.

Daily Timeframe Recommendation
- Optimized for use on the daily timeframe for the most reliable results.

How It Works

Data Collection
- The indicator collects historical data for the chosen lookback period on a daily timeframe.
- Seasonal values are computed by dividing historical data into bins (e.g., trading days of the year).

Seasonality Calculations
- Daily Price Change: Computes the daily price change for each trading day.
- Average Seasonal Change: Calculates the average price movement for each bin.
- Normalization: Normalizes seasonal trends to align with the current price scale.

Trend Projections
- Smoothed seasonal trends are projected into the future based on historical patterns.
- Potential upside and downside scenarios are highlighted using pivot labels.

Trend and Pivot Detection
- Identifies past and future trends as "Upward" or "Downward."
- Marks pivot points ("Top Pivot" or "Bottom Pivot") based on significant seasonal changes.

Best Practices
- Use on Daily Timeframe: The indicator is optimized for daily charts to maximize accuracy and reliability.
- Combine with Other Tools: Use in conjunction with Sentiment Analysis (COT), Valuation Measurements, and 
  Trend Confirmation Tools (Moving Averages).
- Focus on Forecast Days: Adjust forecast days based on your trading horizon (e.g., 90 days for 
  medium-term analysis).
- Leverage Pivots: Pay attention to pivot alerts to anticipate potential reversals or trend continuations.

Long-term View:
- Spot major Cycle Bottom and Cycle Top.

Short-term View:
- Spot Local Highs and Lows.

FAQs
- Why are some lines missing?
  Ensure sufficient historical data is available for the selected lookback period.

- Can I use the indicator for daily or weekly timeframes?
  The indicator is optimized for daily charts to ensure the highest accuracy when calculating seasonal trends 
  and future projections. While it can be applied to weekly or monthly charts, the results may not be as precise 
  due to differences in data granularity.

- How do I interpret the "Smoothing Period"?
  The smoothing period adjusts how much noise is reduced in the projected trends. A lower smoothing period 
  captures finer details but may appear choppy, while a higher smoothing period provides a smoother, more 
  general trend line by averaging data over a longer range.

- How does the indicator handle assets with limited historical data?
  For assets with less historical data than the selected lookback period, the indicator uses the available data 
  but may produce less accurate seasonal projections. For best results, choose assets with at least as much 
  historical data as your selected lookback period.
