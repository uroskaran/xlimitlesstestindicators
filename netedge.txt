XLimitless - NetEdge Indicators (COT) Documentation

Introduction
The "XLimitless - NetEdge Indicators (COT)" series provides a granular view of 
market positioning by focusing on three key market participant groups:

- Retail Traders (Non-Reportables): Tracks the net long, short, and overall net 
  positions of small retail participants.

- Large Speculators (Non-Commercials): Highlights speculative positions taken 
  by institutional players such as Banks, Hedge Funds, and Large Traders.

- Commercials (Users & Producers): Displays hedging activities by entities that 
  use the asset for business purposes.

Each indicator in this series is designed to help traders gauge the sentiment of 
these participant groups and identify potential market extremes.

Indicators Overview

1. XLimitless - NetEdge Retail (COT)
   - Purpose: Analyzes retail trader sentiment by plotting long, short, and net 
     positions.
   - Displays long positions (green line), short positions (red line), and net 
     positions (shaded area in red).
   - Zero line for reference to indicate net neutrality.
   - Best Use Case: Identify when retail traders are overly biased in one direction 
     to anticipate reversals.

2. XLimitless - NetEdge Large Speculators (COT)
   - Purpose: Provides insights into the speculative activities of large market 
     participants.
   - Displays long positions (green line), short positions (red line), and net 
     positions (shaded area in gray).
   - Zero line for reference to indicate net neutrality.
   - Best Use Case: Use as a contrarian signal when large speculators reach 
     extreme positions.

3. XLimitless - NetEdge Commercials (COT)
   - Purpose: Tracks the hedging activities of Commercials, who typically act in 
     the opposite direction of market trends.
   - Displays long positions (green line), short positions (red line), and net 
     positions (shaded area in green).
   - Zero line for reference to indicate net neutrality.

How It Works

Data Source:
The indicators utilize the Commitment of Traders (COT) Legacy reports, accessing 
data via TradingView’s COT Library. Positions are categorized as follows:

- Retail Traders (Non-Reportables): Small, non-professional traders.
- Large Speculators (Non-Commercials): Institutional traders, hedge funds.
- Commercials (Users & Producers): Businesses that use the asset for 
  production or risk management.

Plotting Mechanics:
- Long Positions: Total long positions for the participant group.
- Short Positions: Total short positions for the participant group.
- Net Positions: Calculated as Long - Short.
- Zero Line: Indicates neutrality in net positioning.

Best Practices:
- Use in conjunction with Technical Analysis: Combine these indicators with 
  support/resistance levels or trend indicators for higher confidence trades.
- Understand Positioning Dynamics: The chart visualizes the interplay between 
  long, short, and net positions, providing insights into market sentiment.
- Focus on Extremes: Retail Traders' high net long/short positions may signal 
  potential trend exhaustion.
- Regular Updates: Check data on the weekly timeframe, as COT reports are 
  published every Friday.
