How It Works

Data Normalization
- For each market participant group, the indicator calculates net long positions:
  - Commercials: Bullish vs. Bearish Extreme.
  - Large Speculators: Bullish vs. Bearish Extreme.
  - Retail Traders: Bullish vs. Bearish Extreme.
- The data is normalized to a 0-100% scale using historical minimum and maximum values for better comparison.

Open Interest Analysis
- Open Interest data is normalized over the chosen lookback period to highlight extreme market activity levels.

Dynamic Updates
- Data updates daily or weekly (depending on the timeframe used).

Best Practices for Using SMI

1. Combine with Other Analysis
- Use SMI with technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, Trend Following) to strengthen confluence.

2. Focus on Extremes
- Look for alignments between participant extremes and open interest shifts for high-confidence trade setups.

3. Use Long-Term Trends for Market Sentiment
- Longer lookback periods (156+ weeks) capture broader sentiment and trend shifts more effectively.

Example Use Case

Scenario: Analyzing Dollar Futures
Setup:

- Open Interest shows a sharp decrease.

Conclusion:
- A trend reversal is imminent.
- Consider entering a Long position, aligning with Commercial sentiment.
- Look for a counter-pair setup such as EUR/USD or GBP/USD for additional confirmation.
